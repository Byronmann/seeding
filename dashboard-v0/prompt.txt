Design a modern "Apple Music Analytics Admin Dashboard" for data analysts and executives.

The dashboard consumes a REST API with 5 endpoints:

1) GET /api/royalties?days=30  
   - Returns a list of artists with the totalSeconds streamed in the last 30 days.

2) GET /api/top-songs?country=GT&days=7  
   - Returns the Top 10 most played songs in a specific country and time window.

3) GET /api/users/zombies  
   - Returns Premium users with no activity in the last 30 days (churn risk).

4) GET /api/demographics/reggaeton  
   - Returns the age distribution of users that listen to Reggaeton.

5) GET /api/heavy-users?artist=Bad Bunny&limit=5  
   - Returns the users that listened to the highest number of distinct songs from a given artist.

Layout requirements:

- Top navigation bar with Apple Music logo, page title "Apple Music Analytics", user avatar on the right.
- Left sidebar with sections:
  - Overview
  - Royalties
  - Top Songs
  - Churn & Zombies
  - Demographics
  - Heavy Users

Main screen sections:

1) Overview section (top of the page):
   - KPI cards showing:
     - Total streams (last 30 days)
     - Total active users
     - Number of Premium users
     - Number of Zombie users
   - A small line chart of "Streams per day" (sample data is OK).

2) Royalties section:
   - Bar chart showing totalSeconds per artist (top 5).
   - Table below with columns: Artist, Total Seconds, Estimated Royalties (USD), Last Update.
   - Use a clean minimalist look that could fit Apple’s design language.

3) Top Songs section:
   - Country filter (dropdown with GT, US, MX, etc.).
   - Days filter (7, 14, 30).
   - Table listing the 10 most played songs with columns:
     - Rank, Title, Artist, Total Reproductions, Country.
   - Optional horizontal bar chart for totalReproductions per song.

4) Churn & Zombie Users section:
   - Card explaining: "Premium users with no activity in the last 30 days".
   - Table with columns:
     - Username, Email, Country, Subscription, Status (ZOMBIE).
   - Badge or pill component to highlight the ZOMBIE status in red/orange.
   - KPI showing "Total Zombie Premium Users".

5) Demographics section:
   - Bar chart for age buckets (15-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-60, 61+).
   - Each bar uses the totalListeners metric.
   - Secondary metric shown as tooltip or small text: avgAge per bucket.
   - Short explanatory text: "Age distribution of users that listened to Reggaeton".

6) Heavy Users section:
   - Card title: "Heavy Users – Bad Bunny".
   - Table listing:
     - UserId (or masked ID), Total Distinct Songs, Example Country.
   - Optionally a small leaderboard style layout (top 5 users).

General style:

- Use a dark theme inspired by Apple Music with accent color in pink / purple.
- Clean typography, enough spacing, rounded cards, subtle shadows.
- Make it look like a real product dashboard ready to be implemented with React + Tailwind.
- Place sample data in all tables and charts so the UI looks complete.
